### Module 1: Introduction to Cloud (90 Minutes)

#### 1.1 Introduction to Cloud Computing
- **Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:**
  - **Massive Scalability:** Ability to add resources at a large scale.
  - **Resilient Computing:** Nearly zero downtime and continuous availability.
  - **Homogeneity:** Homogeneous virtual systems despite non-homogeneous underlying hardware.
  - **Geographic Distribution:** Data centers distributed globally.
  - **Virtualization:** Ability to virtualize servers, storage, and other resources.
  - **Service Orientation:** Features provided as software services.
  - **Low-Cost Software:** Lower average unit and per-use cost.
  - **Advanced Security:** Network-level and application-level security provisions.

- **Five Essential Characteristics of Cloud Systems:**
  - **On-Demand Self-Service:** Access to services without intervention.
  - **Broad Network Access:** Services accessible over the network using standard protocols.
  - **Resource Pooling:** Pooled resources provided to users.
  - **Measured Service:** Built-in metering for charging users based on usage.
  - **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down based on requirements.

- **Deployment Models:**
  - **Private Cloud:** Exclusively for an organization, high security, and control.
  - **Public Cloud:** For general users, charged based on usage, less secure.
  - **Community Cloud:** Jointly implemented by organizations with shared concerns.
  - **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of two or more cloud types, providing high security and availability.

#### 1.2 Cloud Computing Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Advantages:**
  - **Location-Independent Access:** Flexibility for remote teams.
  - **Cost Reduction:** Reduced up-front investment, TCO, and TOC.
  - **Dynamic Infrastructure:** Reduced costs and improved services.
  - **Increased Flexibility:** On-demand, scalable, and adaptable services.
  - **Reliable Performance:** Consistent availability and performance.
  - **Faster Recovery and Resilience:** Higher resilience and faster recovery.
  - **Scale:** Unlimited processing, storage, and networking capabilities.
  - **Better Support:** Automatic updates and improved compatibility.
  - **Improved Teamwork Capabilities:** Easier collaboration.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Higher Connectivity Requirements:** Requires high-speed network and connectivity.
  - **Potential Security Risks:** Privacy and security issues in public clouds.
  - **Increased External Dependency:** Dependency on external providers for mission-critical applications.
  - **Increased Monitoring Required:** Constant monitoring and enforcement of SLAs.

#### 1.3 Service Models in Cloud
- **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** Users access applications running on a cloud infrastructure.
- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** Provider delivers a platform for the software development life cycle.
- **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** Infrastructure made available to users over the internet.
- **Other Services:** Storage as a Service (STaaS), Database as a Service (DBaaS), Function as a Service (FaaS), Desktop as a Service (DaaS), Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS).

#### 1.4 X as Code
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Management and provisioning of infrastructure through code.
- **Platform as Code (PaC):** Management and provisioning of execution environments through code.
- **Compliance as Code (CaC):** Codification of compliance controls for automation.

#### 1.5 Cost of Cloud Computing
- **Pay-Per-Use Model:** Users charged based on the type of CPU, amount of RAM, storage, and usage time.
- **Cost Considerations:**
  - **Public vs. Private vs. On-Prem:** Migration to the cloud reduces upfront costs but may increase data communication costs.
  - **CPU-Intensive vs. Data-Intensive Jobs:** Cloud provides lower costs for CPU-intensive jobs compared to data-intensive jobs.

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to cloud computing, covering its key characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, service models, and cost considerations.
