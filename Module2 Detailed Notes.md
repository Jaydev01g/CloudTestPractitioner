### Detailed Notes on Module 2: Cloud Technology and Terminology

#### 2.1 Virtualization, Hypervisors, and Hyperscalers

**Virtualization:**
- **Definition:** Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of a storage device, an operating system, a server, or network resources. It is a key technology behind cloud computing.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Resource Optimization:** Allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, optimizing resource use.
  - **Isolation:** Provides isolation between different VMs, enhancing security and stability.
  - **Flexibility:** Enables easy scaling and management of resources.

**Hypervisors:**
- **Definition:** Hypervisors are software tools used to create and manage virtual machines (VMs).
- **Types of Hypervisors:**
  - **Type 1 Hypervisors (Bare-Metal Virtualization):** Run directly on the system hardware. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.
  - **Type 2 Hypervisors (OS Virtualization):** Run on a host operating system that provides virtualization services. Examples include VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.

**Hyperscalers:**
- **Definition:** Hyperscalers are systems that provide the ability to scale resources as demand increases. They are typically large cloud service providers.
- **Examples of Hyperscalers:**
  - **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Offers a wide range of cloud services, including computing, storage, and databases.
  - **Microsoft Azure:** Provides cloud services for computing, analytics, storage, and networking.
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Offers cloud computing services, including data storage, machine learning, and data analytics.

#### 2.2 Load Balancing

**Load Balancing:**
- **Definition:** Load balancing is the distribution of computing workloads across multiple resources (CPUs, computer clusters, etc.) to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.
- **Types of Load Balancers:**
  - **Hardware Load Balancers:** Physical devices that distribute network or application traffic.
  - **Software Load Balancers:** Software applications that perform load balancing functions.
  - **Cloud Load Balancers:** Load balancing services provided by cloud providers.

**Benefits of Load Balancing:**
- **Improved Performance:** Distributes traffic to multiple servers, reducing the load on each server and improving overall performance.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensures high availability by redirecting traffic to healthy servers in case of server failure.
- **Scalability:** Allows for easy scaling of applications by adding or removing servers as needed.

**Cloud Load Balancing:**
- **Internal Load Balancers:** Used for servers on the internal network with private IP addresses.
- **Internet-Facing Load Balancers:** Receive user requests and typically pass them on to web servers.

#### 2.3 Containerization

**Containerization:**
- **Definition:** Containerization is the packaging together of software code with all its necessary components like libraries, frameworks, and other dependencies so that they are isolated in their own "container."
- **Advantages of Containers:**
  - **Flexibility:** Can containerize even the most complex applications.
  - **Lightweight:** Leverages and shares the host kernel, making containers more lightweight than VMs.
  - **Interchangeable:** Allows for easy deployment of updates and upgrades.
  - **Portable:** Can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
  - **Scalable:** Can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
  - **Stackable:** Can stack services on the fly.

**Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs):**
- **Containers:**
  - Run natively on an operating system (OS) and share the kernel of the host machine with other containers.
  - Consume fewer resources than VMs.
  - Provide less isolation compared to VMs.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**
  - Run a full-blown "guest" OS.
  - Consume more resources than containers.
  - Provide more isolation and security compared to containers.

**Docker:**
- **Definition:** Docker is a global leading platform for building applications using containers.
- **Components:**
  - **Docker Image:** A read-only template used to create Docker containers.
  - **Docker Engine:** A client-server application that runs Docker containers.
  - **Docker Registry:** Stores Docker images. Public registries include Docker Hub and Docker Cloud.

**Kubernetes:**
- **Definition:** Kubernetes is an open-source platform that orchestrates the placement (scheduling) and execution of application containers within and across computer clusters.
- **Components:**
  - **Kubernetes Cluster:** A cluster of computers connected to work as a single unit.
  - **The Master:** Coordinates the cluster.
  - **Nodes:** Workers that run applications.
  - **Pods:** The unit of replication in Kubernetes, housing containers for scheduling and execution.
